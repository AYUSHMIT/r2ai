identify the language used in the code snippet and write a short comment to be placed on top of the function to document what it does. print only the function signature, and put the new comment on top, right before the function name. the comment should not contain more than one sentence. also explain the time complexity if relevant. stop after the first 'dot'. do not include the whole function implementation.
